# ANTLRv4 scala to cpp sketch

### Notes:
[Official site](https://www.antlr.org/)
[Tutorial](https://engineering.mongodb.com/post/transpiling-between-any-programming-languages-part-1)

This is just a sketch to have something to brainstorm about.

### TODO:
- Like literally everything,
- parse tree as tree no list,

### Blockers & Brianstorm:
- Grammar to grammar conversion.
- Different structures.
- Syntactics support for:
  1. Building code based on partial/sub grammars on the fly? 
  2. Mapping partial/sub grammars from one language to another?
  (or did I just miss it in ANTLR's documentation and code?)
